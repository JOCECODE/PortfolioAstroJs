# XiLFTEN

Xilften is "Netflix" spelled backwards and it is a front-end Ui clone of the popular streaming site Netflix. It was created using react and css. If the selected movie doesn't have a trailer available for it a YouTube video will play instead which is one that I created! It is hosted using Firebase and it uses movie-trailers api. Soon, there will be an update to the application to incorporate React-Player which is going to provide more movie-trailers.
